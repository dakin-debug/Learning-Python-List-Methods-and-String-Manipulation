# Learning-Python-List-Methods-and-String-Manipulation

# 1. Create a list named food with two elements, "rice" and "beans".
food = ["rice", "beans"]

# 2. Append the string "broccoli" to food using .append().
food.append("broccoli")

# 3. Add the strings "bread" and "pizza" to food using .extend().
food.extend(["bread", "pizza"])

# 4. Print the first two items in the food list using print() and slice notation.
first_two_items = food[0:2]
print(first_two_items)

# 5. Print the last item in food using print() and index notation.
last_item = food[-1]
print(last_item)

# 6. Create a list called breakfast from the string "eggs, fruit, orange juice" using the string .split() method.
breakfast = "eggs, fruit, orange juice"
breakfast_list = breakfast.split(",")
print(breakfast_list)

# 7. Verify that breakfast has three items using len().
number_of_items = len(breakfast_list)
print(number_of_items)

# 8. Create a new list called lengths using a list comprehension that contains the lengths of each string 
# in the breakfast list.
lengths = [len(word) for word in breakfast_list]
print(lengths)
